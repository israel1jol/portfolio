## DotHatake

Hey, I'm Dot but you can also refer to me as Israel ðŸ§” . 
I'm a 19yr old CS Major from the University of Lagos, Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬, a MERN stack and Laravel PHP software developer.

### My Journey
I started programming in 2015 and my first learning tool was scratch from MIT. 
I developed alot of cool applications with it for about four months but I didn't really do much with it afterward.
In 2018, I decided to take up programming again and went ahead to learn python.
This was the first actual programming language I had learnt and I felt proud of myself for pushing through Tim Berners-Lee 300+ page book.
I learnt alot about programming in general and it really helped solidify my understanding of core programming concepts.
Sadly, I didn't do much with python after completing the book except creating a few basic apps with Tkinter and turtle.
Two years later, I decided to create my github account and actually give this programming thing some serious consideration
and so I took up HTML, CSS and Javascript. In just a month, I was creating static web apps that I could be proud of. But that wasn't enough 
for me so I learnt the react framework. I fell in love with it, it felt so easy to begin with, like I was reuniting with something i didn't know
I had lost. I then took up FE libraries such as SASS and BOOTSTRAP.
